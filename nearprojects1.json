The first and most hyped use-case for NFT\u2019s has been Art. Although we love to see artists using this technology (and thriving!), we know the full potential of purposeful NFTs is not being fully explored yet. What does that mean? We believe in NFTs with practical applications and use cases: membership access, ticketing, communal projects, redeemable NFTs and so much more. For us, NFTs represent the grounds for a new financial system. By providing verifiable digital ownership, the possibilities created are endless: they\u2019re scarce, interoperable and cryptographically secure. With our split royalties and revenue features, collaborative projects have a whole other way to deal with their finances.  At Mintbase, everyone gets their own smart contract and can add several minters to their store. Think \u201cShopify for NFTs\u201d: People can create their stores to sell music, art, tickets, memberships and much more. In a nutshell, anything can be tokenized. The Mintbase interface can easily be used, but via our SDK anyone can spin off their own NFT marketplaces.

Historically, projects conducted initial token distribution through centralized auctions, DEX offerings, and fixed-cost sales which were unfair by limiting participation due to geo-location, being vulnerable to front-running bots, sybil attacks, multi-account registration, and unclear price discovery. Private sales and venture capital limited the ability of the general public from being able to access tokens from day zero by distributing large amounts of tokens at a low price, which gives advantage to the private parties and well-connected participants. It also hurts project founders who are strapped for resources at the early stages of their entrepreneurial journey and don\u2019t have a sophisticated network to get access to initial capital. It\u2019s the community that drives project distribution and success, so we believe it should be trivial to enable its participation from the very beginning. Skyward Finance\u2019s goal is to provide mechanisms for initial price discovery and token distribution through a streaming time-based auctions that are accessible to the general public in a decentralized way, while being resistant to front-running, price manipulations, and sybil attacks.

When creating Sarcophagus, we wanted to keep a few megatrends in mind. One of the most important trends of our era is the shift from conventional warfare to digital. During the Cold War, superpowers fought by displaying military might and funding small proxy wars. In the late 20th century through today, superpowers wage wars against specific ideologies. As we enter the next phase of human warfare, we will see a shift in power dynamics from use of raw materials and human labor to human creativity and innovation. Human innovation has forever advanced warfare, and individuals like Mikhail Kalashnikov and John Browning have invented weapons that thrive today largely unchanged. We'd like to think that the world in which Kalashnikov invented the AK-47 (1947) or when Browning released the M1911 (1911) was wildly different from the world we live in today. But we\u2019d be wrong. We may have more powerful weapons, global air travel, and instant communications, but the driving forces behind these innovations haven\u2019t changed. We still experience the same strife, hunger and subjugation. Our goal in creating Sarcophagus is to hand back a little bit of power to the person with nothing more than an internet connection. We want the creative forces of warfare to err in favor of the individual, and we believe that the power of decentralization mixed with strong cryptography is the best way to achieve this goal. Stuxnet was a masterpiece, and it was unveiled to the public in 2010 - the same year Instagram was founded and the iPhone 4 was released. The tech world has changed a lot since then, and so has the crypto landscape. Since digital warfare does not require the same natural resources or financial expenditures as traditional warfare, we expect a playing field that is more egalitarian than the military powers of the late 20th century. Digital weapons are created, bought, and sold in a different type of market than before. Digital arms don\u2019t get delivered by transport plane stamped with a country of origin; they move anonymously on the dark web. We think of Sarcophagus as a tool in a personal digital arsenal. It may not hold the same significance as the rifle on a soldier\u2019s back; but neither does a cellphone. They are both important tools that are owned by billions.

The Chainlink Network is a decentralized network of ChainLink Nodes, which are all selling usage of specific data feeds, APIs and various off-chain payment capabilities directly to a smart contract. Any data, payments, e-signature, or other API provider, as well as individual developers, can easily join the network by connecting an API they're familiar with. Once the API they'd like to offer to smart contracts is connected to a ChainLink, they become a ChainLink Node Operator, responsible for keeping that API connected to the ChainLink Network and being compensated in LINK for their successful fulfillment of on-chain requests. The LINK token is an EIP20 token with additional ERC667 functionality. The total supply of the token is 1,000,000,000, and each token is divisible up to 18 decimal places.

The main goal of strengthening the community through swag, culture and fashion. As the first project in Swagger DAO, we\u2019ve have been working on some updates for the NEAR Swag and the store. The main object of NEAR SWAG 2.0 is to create the best print-on-demand apparel and merchandise collection and store set-up in the crypto space for the NEAR Community. Over-all, the aim of this update is to: Explore and push the boundaries of crypto swag fashion and commerce from a both product, marketing and technical integration aspect. That said working within the limits of the dogma of maximum automatization using print-on-demand production. Present quality sourced goods manufactured and handled logistically in the most environmental and cost efficient way with the best NEAR SWAG product ever. Develop processes for NEAR Swag to autogenerate, develop and create graphics and products in co-creation through various communities, projects and guilds within the great community of NEAR. In order to make some nice products, we have to: Source quality products with an automatized supply chain. NEAR is not a clothing company with actual stock of goods. We will crunch those challenges by choosing solutions that create automatization which means: The production supply chain link is automatized via Printful\u2019s print-on-demand services offering low cost production locally in their production network upon order confirmation. All clothing products will have a NEAR logo printed on the inner back for a full NEAR SWAG product experience and not a branded Fruit Of The Loom t-shirt with logo printed on front as it is today. Then, by connecting these services and solutions, NEAR SWAG becomes a swag brand that runs with a fully decentralized and automatized design-, marketing-, production-, commerce-, payment- and logistic operational set-up. To do this we would like to : Use the metrics of fashion commerce, PR and brand building to increase anticipation, excitement and hype of new NEAR SWAG product releases. Make products that both employees, developers, contributors, guild members and fans of NEAR etc. are dying to show off everywhere they go, because it\u2019s a nice product that represents a project they truly believe in. Furthermore present a product that appeals to non-crypto natives and in the end also serve as a NEAR on-boarding touch point and case study on how to tap into different creative business genres.\nEncourage the community to participate whether it\u2019s setting up bounties, events and collabs etc. within NEAR guilds, communities and dApps in the design and graphic development process to accumulate content and material for a full circle NEAR community brand journey. A few facts about the store and upcoming initiatives: New store design - build on dShop on Origin protocol:\nThe store is built on the world\u2019s first decentralized e-commerce platform, blockchain-powered project Origin Protocol on their dShop solution which offers integration with decentralized printing company Printful. Pay with $NEAR, other cryptocurrencies or credit card:\nPayment with NEAR token is already possible as well as Moonpay for other cryptocurrency payments such as ETH and DAI. Payment through Stripe integration for credit card payment with VISA or Mastercard is also possible. NFT minted for each NEAR SWAG product:\nEach product from NEAR SWAG will have an NFT minted presumably via Mintbase which the buyer receives to their NEAR address upon claiming it after order confirmation in the store. This integration will be added in 4-6 weeks from now. That means that this will be the last NEAR SWAG products without NFT.

The objective is to incentivize early liquidity providers with added incentive for bootstrapping the pools. In Uniswap, LPs earn fees so long as liquidity is provided. Sushiswap aims to add a more passive form of income with early LPs benefitting from the future traction of the protocol through SUSHI and the 0.05% fee.

Their goal is to eliminate these inefficiencies and also instill trust between buyers and sellers. Glyde is the first to put advanced mobile diagnostic tools that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and wireless carriers use in the hands of buyers and sellers, allowing them to securely test the condition of mobile phones as they transact. The Glyde Marketplace is also the first to use smart contracts to minimize fraud and discourage unscrupulous buyers and sellers that currently plague today's peer-to-peer marketplaces that sell used devices. TessaB has teamed up with NEAR Protocol for layer one of the blockchain. This will provide the foundation for a fairer marketplace for both individual consumers and businesses, one in which transactions are more transparent and, as a result, prices more accurately reflect the quality and value of the device.

The platform utilizes smart contracts and economic incentives to create successful ecosystems which provide access to decentralized loans for borrowers, yield for lenders and insights for data providers. It allows borrowers to lock parts of their funds in a protocol and lenders to lend money overtime on a contract that defines the terms of the loan: rate, length, and other conditions. The idea is to allow borrowers to access liquid funds instantly while leveraging the benefits of lending. Flappy Protocol\u2019s v1 launch will support USDT, USDC, DAI, ETH, AURORA, NEAR. Users will be able to lend and borrow these assets at attractive APR. For lending their assets to the market, lenders receive an auto-compounding, synthetic token called fUSDT, fUSDC, fDAI, fETH, fAURORA, fNEAR and fTRI. This token represents the amount they contributed to the pool and the interest earned by the asset. Just by holding the tokens, users earn interest in the same asset the token represents and though fUSDT, fUSDC, fDAI, fETH, fAURORA, fNEAR are currently non-transferable, subsequent releases will add more utility through various partnerships. FLP token powers Flappy Protocol. 70% of the total supply will be used for given as incentives for lenders, borrowers and liquidity providers.", "Grants": null, "News Articles": null, "WalletSelector_Comments1": null, "WalletSelector_Comments2": null, "Notes": null, "Date_Created": null}, {"ProjectName": "Nexon Finance", "Category": "Aurora,DApps,DeFi,Lending", "Subtitle": "Lending Protocol on Aurora.", "AwesomeNearLink": "https://awesomenear.com/nexon-finance", "Series": "COMING SOON,AURORA", "ABBV": null, "Icon": "https://awesome-near.s3.amazonaws.com/nexon-finance.jpg", "Website Link": "https://nexon.finance/", "Buy Link": null, "Stake Link": null, "DApp Link": null, "Facebook": null, "Twitter": "https://twitter.com/NexonFi", "Github": null, "Telegram": null, "Discord": "https://discord.com/invite/kPZ9ycpyng", "Linkedin": null, "Medium": "https://nexon-finance.medium.com/", "Other Links": null, "Near Token": null, "Aurora Token": null, "Ethereum Token": null, "Other Tokens": null, "Description": " Nexon is a decentralized algorithm-based lending protocol on Aurora.

Combining the NFT collectible boom with event experiences, our marketplace allows you to incentivise your audience by minting unique NFTs that can be airdropped to ticket holders during or after every event.

Current Web3 protocols operate in a trustless space where the same permissions are given to honest users, bots and attackers. This limits the scope of financial products that can be offered by DeFi protocols and stifles the development of trust within communities on the blockchain. We propose a decentralised Notebook to keeps a log of a user's activities on the blockchain, enabling transparency and building a proxy-identity without exposing personal information.

Our goal is to eliminate the barrier of entry for the masses to buy, sell and trade NFTs. We are giving the power back to people. You don\u2019t need to be tech savvy to get into the NFT world with us, if you ever purchased anything online you will have the knowledge to purchase one of Drawtring\u2019s creators NFTs.  We have developed an end to end solution for the entire nft (and marketing) process for our clients. Drawstring takes the entire confusing build process out of the creator's hands. We come up with the entire game plan, launch, community build, marketing and PR.  Drawstring gives creators a massive revenue stream opportunity while simultaneously giving their fans a deeper way to connect with them. The NFTs our creators launch will all have real world utility. They will give fans exclusive access to certain things the artists release such as music, merch, personalized access and calls, events, shout outs, and concerts. Skies the limit. We are essentially creating living/breathing fan clubs, web 3.0 version. Nfts should really be all about utility, I own this dope piece of digital art and it gives me access to xyz in the real world. It\u2019s truly linking the virtual world with reality.  Additionally, NEAR happens to be the only blockchain with on-chain royalties which is the key to truly giving the power back to the artist. The creator will get a piece of every future NFT resale no matter where the owner chooses to sell it.  What we are great at as well is dropping nfts at mass which you can\u2019t do on Ethereum. This is a huge opportunity for anyone with a fan base or high traffic venues. It costs $100-200 to mint a nft on eth, on our platform it\u2019s a few cents. This allows our clients to make NFTs at a price point that makes sense for their fans. It gives them the power to launch as many campaigns as they see fit.  Creators can also drop free NFTs to their most engaged fans across all existing social media platforms. It\u2019s easy and cost-effective to drop THOUSANDS of free NFTs and engage more of their fanbase in a new way. We have the power to do free airdrops of NFTs at any venue or event or even have hidden QR codes around the facility that gives people exclusive NFTs. Our other main focus is to get a secondary marketplace live for the NEAR ecosystem. We want all of our creators' fans to have a great user-friendly platform to buy, sell and trade their NFTs. We also want to make sure the NEAR community can link their wallet and sell their assets no matter where their NFT\u2019s were minted (our site, Mintbase, Paras, Satori, Aurora etc).  We will allow creators in the NEAR ecosystem to build out projects and launch on our platform. Which means homegrown projects can still get traction and become uber successful. We are going to be driving so much traffic to the site, we want to give users a reason to stay and continuously use the platform.
